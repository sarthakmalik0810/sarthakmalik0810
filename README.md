✌<br>Hello There!

I'm Sarthak.</br>
I'm **Sarthak Malik**, a Senior Frontend Engineer at [Simpplr](https://www.simpplr.com), currently working in the **Frontend Architecture** team.

🛠️ I spend most of my time:
- Building and maintaining shared UI components and internal tools
- Improving DX and frontend workflows across teams
- Helping teams adopt and contribute to our design system
- Collaborating closely with designers and engineers to ship better UIs

🔧 Tools & tech I enjoy working with:
`React`, `TypeScript`, `Storybook`, `Tailwind`, `Vite`, `Jest`, and other frontend toys.

💬 Also into:
- UI consistency, clean code, and small details that make big differences
- Mentoring, reviewing PRs (sometimes too thoroughly), and refining processes
